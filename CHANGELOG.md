**Gameplay**

- Made item entities lose durability from fire/cactus/etc instead of disappearing
- Added cooldown to shield durability loss for case of mobs without an attack cooldown, like slimes

**Technical**

- Made registered repair materials persist during runtime
- Fixed some faulty calculations and conditionals
- Properly listed mod dependencies
- Properly implemented SemVer
- Listed Hexasan (translator) as contributor in-game
- Completely rewrote, and restructured the code internally

**Developers Note**: As this update comes with a fairly large code rewrite, I anticipate there will be bugs. In case of
that happening, please make an [issue](https://github.com/sylenthuntress/Unbreakable/issues) or join my Discord to
notify me.
